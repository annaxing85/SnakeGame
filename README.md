# SnakeGame

## Description 
In the Snake Game, the player controls the movement of a snake with the up/down/left/right keyboard keys. The aim is to move the snake towards a target apple to eat it, without falling off the edges of the screen. A score system keeps track of the playerâ€™s progress. The position of the snake and the food is random at the start of the game. The background color changes everytime the player loses the game. The snake size gets smaller and larger randomly.
